  <h1>Requirements Elicitation – Software Engineering</h1>
  <p><strong>Last Updated: 14 Mar, 2024</strong></p>

  <h2 class="section-title">What is Requirement Elicitation?</h2>
  <p>Requirements elicitation is perhaps the most difficult, most error-prone, and most communication-intensive software development.</p>
  <p>It can be successful only through an effective customer-developer partnership. It is needed to know what the users require.</p>
  <p>Requirements elicitation involves the identification, collection, analysis, and refinement of the requirements for a software system.</p>
  <p>It is a critical part of the software development life cycle and is typically performed at the beginning of the project.</p>
  <p>Requirements elicitation involves stakeholders from different areas of the organization, including business owners, end-users, and technical experts.</p>
  <p>The output of the requirements elicitation process is a set of clear, concise, and well-defined requirements that serve as the basis for the design and development of the software system.</p>

  <h2 class="section-title">Importance of Requirements Elicitation</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><span class="highlight">Compliance with Business Objectives:</span> The process of elicitation guarantees that the software development endeavors are in harmony with the wider company aims and objectives. Comprehending the business context facilitates the development of a solution that adds value for the company.</li>
    <li><span class="highlight">User Satisfaction:</span> It is easier to create software that fulfills end users’ needs and expectations when they are involved in the requirements elicitation process. Higher user pleasure and acceptance of the finished product are the results of this.</li>
    <li><span class="highlight">Time and Money Savings:</span> Having precise and well-defined specifications aids in preventing miscommunication and rework during the development phase. As a result, there will be cost savings and the project will be completed on time.</li>
    <li><span class="highlight">Compliance and Regulation Requirements:</span> Requirements elicitation is crucial for projects in regulated industries to guarantee that the software conforms with applicable laws and norms. In industries like healthcare, finance, and aerospace, this is crucial.</li>
    <li><span class="highlight">Traceability and Documentation:</span> Throughout the software development process, traceability is based on well-documented requirements. Traceability helps with testing, validation, and maintenance by ensuring that every part of the software can be linked to a particular requirement.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 class="section-title">Requirements Elicitation Activities</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Knowledge of the overall area where the systems are applied.</li>
    <li>The details of the precise customer problem where the system is going to be applied must be understood.</li>
    <li>Interaction of system with external requirements.</li>
    <li>Detailed investigation of user needs.</li>
    <li>Define the constraints for system development.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 class="section-title">Requirements Elicitation Methods</h2>
  <ol>
    <li><span class="highlight">Interviews:</span> The objective of conducting an interview is to understand the customer’s expectations of the software. It is impossible to interview every stakeholder hence representatives from groups are selected based on their expertise and credibility.</li>
    <li><span class="highlight">Brainstorming Sessions:</span> It is a group technique intended to generate lots of new ideas hence providing a platform to share views. A highly trained facilitator is required to handle group bias and conflicts.</li>
    <li><span class="highlight">Facilitated Application Specification Technique:</span> Its objective is to bridge the expectation gap – the difference between what the developers think they are supposed to build and what customers think they are going to get. A team-oriented approach is developed for requirements gathering.</li>
    <li><span class="highlight">Quality Function Deployment:</span> In this technique customer satisfaction is of prime concern, hence it emphasizes the requirements that are valuable to the customer.</li>
    <li><span class="highlight">Use Case Approach:</span> This technique combines text and pictures to provide a better understanding of the requirements. The use cases describe the ‘what’, of a system and not ‘how’.</li>
  </ol>

  <h2 class="section-title">Steps of Requirements Elicitation</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Identify all the stakeholders, e.g., Users, developers, customers, etc.</li>
    <li>List out all requirements from the customer.</li>
    <li>A value indicating the degree of importance is assigned to each requirement.</li>
    <li>In the end the final list of requirements is categorized as: 
      <ul>
        <li>It is possible to achieve.</li>
        <li>It should be deferred and the reason for it.</li>
        <li>It is impossible to achieve and should be dropped off.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h2 class="section-title">Features of Requirements Elicitation</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><span class="highlight">Stakeholder engagement:</span> Requirements elicitation involves engaging with stakeholders such as customers, end-users, project sponsors, and subject-matter experts to understand their needs and requirements.</li>
    <li><span class="highlight">Gathering information:</span> Requirements elicitation involves gathering information about the system to be developed, the business processes it will support, and the end-users who will be using it.</li>
    <li><span class="highlight">Requirement prioritization:</span> Requirements elicitation involves prioritizing requirements based on their importance to the project’s success.</li>
    <li><span class="highlight">Requirements documentation:</span> Requirements elicitation involves documenting the requirements clearly and concisely so that they can be easily understood and communicated to the development team.</li>
    <li><span class="highlight">Validation and verification:</span> Requirements elicitation involves validating and verifying the requirements with the stakeholders to ensure they accurately represent their needs and requirements.</li>
    <li><span class="highlight">Iterative process:</span> Requirements elicitation is an iterative process that involves continuously refining and updating the requirements based on feedback from stakeholders.</li>
    <li><span class="highlight">Communication and collaboration:</span> Requirements elicitation involves effective communication and collaboration with stakeholders, project team members, and other relevant parties to ensure that the requirements are clearly understood and implemented.</li>
    <li><span class="highlight">Flexibility:</span> Requirements elicitation requires flexibility to adapt to changing requirements, stakeholder needs, and project constraints.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 class="section-title">Advantages of Requirements Elicitation</h2>
