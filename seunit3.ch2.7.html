        <h2>What are Class Diagrams?</h2>
        <p>Class diagrams are a type of UML (Unified Modeling Language) diagram used in software engineering to visually represent the structure and relationships of classes within a system. They are used to construct and visualize object-oriented systems.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>What is a Class?</h2>
        <p>In object-oriented programming (OOP), a class is a blueprint or template for creating objects. Each class defines a set of attributes (data members) and methods (functions or procedures) that the objects created from that class will possess.</p>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>UML Class Notation</h2>
        <p>Class notation is a graphical representation used to depict classes and their relationships in object-oriented modeling.</p>
        <img width="100%" src="https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20240118123645/Class-Notation.webp" alt="">
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Relationships between Classes</h2>
        <p>Class diagrams illustrate relationships between classes, such as associations, aggregations, compositions, and inheritance.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Purpose of Class Diagrams</h2>
        <p>Class diagrams provide a high-level overview of a system's design, helping to communicate and document the structure of the software. They are fundamental tools in object-oriented design and play a crucial role in the software development lifecycle.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Benefits of Class Diagrams</h2>
        <p>Class diagrams help in both the design and documentation phases of software development. They provide clarity, facilitate communication among team members, and aid in understanding the system's structure and relationships.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>How to Draw Class Diagrams</h2>
        <p>To draw class diagrams, one needs to identify classes, their attributes, and methods, as well as relationships between classes. Class diagrams typically include class names, attributes, methods, and associations between classes.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Use Cases of Class Diagrams</h2>
        <p>Class diagrams are used in various stages of software development, including requirements analysis, system design, and implementation. They help in visualizing the structure of the system, identifying classes and their relationships, and ensuring consistency and completeness in the design.</p>
