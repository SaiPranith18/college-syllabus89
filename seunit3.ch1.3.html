  <p>Introduction to Design Modeling in Software Engineering:</p>
  <p>Design modeling in software engineering represents the features of the software that helps engineers to develop it effectively, including the architecture, user interface, and component-level detail. Design modeling provides various views of the system, similar to an architectural plan for a home or building. Different methods like data-driven, pattern-driven, or object-oriented methods are used for constructing the design model. All these methods use a set of design principles for designing a model.</p>

    <h2>Working of Design Modeling in Software Engineering</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Data Design:</strong> Represents the data objects and their interrelationships in an entity-relationship diagram. It shows the structure of the data in terms of tables and includes relationships such as one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many.</li>
      <li><strong>Architectural Design:</strong> Defines the relationship between major structural elements of the software. It decomposes the system into interacting components and expresses the system structure as a block diagram.</li>
      <li><strong>User Interfaces Design:</strong> Represents how the software communicates with the user and refers to the product where the user interacts with controls or displays of the product. It becomes efficient after performing usability testing to optimize the interface.</li>
      <li><strong>Component Level Design:</strong> Transforms the structural elements of the software architecture into a procedural description of software components. Components are not concerned with centralized data management issues like backup and security.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Principles of Design Model</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Design must be traceable to the analysis model:</strong> The design model must be traceable to the analysis model, which represents the information, functions, and behavior of the system. This ensures that the design translates all these aspects into architecture and component-level design.</li>
    </ul>
