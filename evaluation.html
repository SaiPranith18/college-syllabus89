    <h1>Software Evolution – Software Engineering</h1>
    

    <h2>What is Software Evolution?</h2>
    <p>The software evolution process includes fundamental activities of change analysis, release planning, system implementation, and releasing a system to customers.</p>
    <p>The cost and impact of these changes are assessed to see how much the system is affected by the change and how much it might cost to implement the change. If the proposed changes are accepted, a new release of the software system is planned. During release planning, all the proposed changes (fault repair, adaptation, and new functionality) are considered. A design is then made on which changes to implement in the next version of the system. The process of change implementation is an iteration of the development process where the revisions to the system are designed, implemented, and tested.</p>

    <h2>Necessity of Software Evolution</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Change in requirement with time</li>
        <li>Environment change</li>
        <li>Errors and bugs</li>
        <li>Security risks</li>
        <li>For having new functionality and features</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Laws used for Software Evolution</h2>
    <div class="law">
        <h3>1. Law of Continuing Change</h3>
        <p>This law states that any software system that represents some real-world reality undergoes continuous change or become progressively less useful in that environment.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="law">
        <h3>2. Law of Increasing Complexity</h3>
        <p>As an evolving program changes, its structure becomes more complex unless effective efforts are made to avoid this phenomenon.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="law">
        <h3>3. Law of Conservation of Organization Stability</h3>
        <p>Over the lifetime of a program, the rate of development of that program is approximately constant and independent of the resource devoted to system development.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="law">
        <h3>4. Law of Conservation of Familiarity</h3>
        <p>This law states that during the active lifetime of the program, changes made in the successive release are almost constant.</p>
