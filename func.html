        <h1>Functional vs Non-Functional Requirements</h1>

        <p>In software engineering, requirements are specifications or descriptions of what a system or software product should do or how it should behave. These requirements are typically categorized into two main types: functional and non-functional requirements.</p>

        <div class="requirements-list">
            <h2>Functional Requirements</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>User-centric:</strong> Functional requirements are derived from the needs and expectations of the system's users. They represent the desired functions or features that users expect the software to perform.</li>
                <li><strong>Behavioral Descriptions:</strong> Functional requirements define the behavior of the system under various conditions. They specify how the system should respond to different inputs and stimuli.</li>
                <li><strong>Verifiable:</strong> Functional requirements can usually be verified through testing. Test cases can be designed to check whether the system behaves as specified in the requirements.</li>
                <li><strong>Captured in Use Cases:</strong> Functional requirements are often captured in the form of use cases, which describe specific interactions between users and the system to achieve particular goals or tasks.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="requirements-list">
            <h2>Non-Functional Requirements</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Quality Attributes:</strong> Non-functional requirements define the quality attributes or properties of the system. They specify how well the system performs certain functions rather than what functions it performs.</li>
                <li><strong>Constraints on Functional Requirements:</strong> Non-functional requirements place constraints on the system's functional requirements. They dictate how the system should fulfill its functional requirements in terms of performance, reliability, and other aspects.</li>
                <li><strong>Measured by Quality Metrics:</strong> Non-functional requirements are often measured using specific quality metrics. For example, performance requirements might specify response times or throughput rates that the system must achieve under certain conditions.</li>
                <li><strong>Captured as Quality Attributes:</strong> Non-functional requirements are typically captured as quality attributes or constraints rather than specific use cases or features.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="example">
            <h2>Examples</h2>
            <p>Examples of functional requirements include user authentication, data validation, report generation, and any other specific features or actions that the software must perform.</p>
            <p>Examples of non-functional requirements include response time, system availability, security measures, and scalability.</p>
