        <p>Formal Technical Reviews (FTR) in software engineering are a systematic and disciplined approach to examining software artifacts, such as requirements specifications, design documents, code, and test plans, to identify defects and improve the quality of the software under development.</p>
        
        <h2>Objectives of Formal Technical Reviews</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Identify and eliminate defects early in the software development process.</li>
            <li>Ensure that the software artifacts meet specified requirements and standards.</li>
            <li>Improve communication and collaboration among team members.</li>
            <li>Transfer knowledge and best practices among team members.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Key Components of Formal Technical Reviews</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Preparation:</strong> Reviewers familiarize themselves with the artifact being reviewed and prepare questions or comments.</li>
            <li><strong>Meeting:</strong> Reviewers gather to discuss the artifact, raise concerns, and document defects.</li>
            <li><strong>Follow-up:</strong> Action items from the review meeting are addressed, and necessary revisions are made to the artifact.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Types of Formal Technical Reviews</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Requirements Review:</strong> Focuses on verifying that the software requirements are complete, consistent, and correct.</li>
            <li><strong>Design Review:</strong> Evaluates the architectural and detailed design of the software for correctness, efficiency, and maintainability.</li>
            <li><strong>Code Review:</strong> Examines the source code to ensure adherence to coding standards, identify potential bugs, and improve code quality.</li>
            <li><strong>Test Plan Review:</strong> Reviews the test plan to verify test coverage, identify missing test cases, and ensure adequacy of testing strategies.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Benefits of Formal Technical Reviews</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Early defect detection and resolution.</li>
            <li>Improved software quality and reliability.</li>
            <li>Knowledge sharing and skill development among team members.</li>
            <li>Enhanced communication and collaboration within the development team.</li>
            <li>Reduced project costs and timelines by preventing rework and late-stage defects.</li>
        </ul>
