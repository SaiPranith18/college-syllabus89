  <h2>Difference Between Architectural Style, Architectural Patterns and Design Patterns</h2>
  <p>Many software professionals think that architectural styles and patterns are the same. Sadly, some of the software developers don’t understand the difference between architectural patterns and design patterns. In this article, we’re going to summarize the differences between them.</p>
  <p>According to MSDN, architectural styles and patterns are the same things. But how can it be? The word style means: “a manner of doing something” while a pattern means: “a repeated decorative design”. However, these definitions show two different things. In software engineering, the terminology must be more clear and describe something specific. So, what’s the difference between the terminologies and how can we differentiate between them?</p>
  
  <h3>Architectural Style</h3>
  <p>The architectural style shows how do we organize our code, or how the system will look like from 10000 feet helicopter view to show the highest level of abstraction of our system design. Furthermore, when building the architectural style of our system we focus on layers and modules and how they are communicating with each other. There are different types of architectural styles, and moreover, we can mix them and produce a hybrid style that consists of a mix between two and even more architectural styles. Below is a list of architectural styles and examples for each category:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Structure architectural styles: such as layered, pipes and filters and component-based styles.</li>
    <li>Messaging styles: such as Implicit invocation, asynchronous messaging and publish-subscribe style.</li>
    <li>Distributed systems: such as service-oriented, peer to peer style, object request broker, and cloud computing styles.</li>
    <li>Shared memory styles: such as role-based, blackboard, database-centric styles.</li>
    <li>Adaptive system styles: such as microkernel style, reflection, domain-specific language styles.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Architectural Patterns</h3>
  <p>The architectural pattern shows how a solution can be used to solve a reoccurring problem. In another word, it reflects how a code or components interact with each other. Moreover, the architectural pattern is describing the architectural style of our system and provides solutions for the issues in our architectural style. Personally, I prefer to define architectural patterns as a way to implement our architectural style. For example: how to separate the UI of the data module in our architectural style? How to integrate a third-party component with our system? how many tires will we have in our client-server architecture? Examples of architectural patterns are microservices, message bus, service requester/ consumer, MVC, MVVM, microkernel, n-tier, domain-driven design, and presentation-abstraction-control.</p>
