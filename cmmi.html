            <h2>Prerequisite – Capability Maturity Model (CMM)</h2>
            <p>Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI) is a successor of CMM and is a more evolved model that
                incorporates best components of individual disciplines of CMM like Software CMM, Systems Engineering
                CMM, People CMM, etc. Since CMM is a reference model of matured practices in a specific discipline, so
                it becomes difficult to integrate these disciplines as per the requirements. This is why CMMI is used as
                it allows the integration of multiple disciplines as and when needed.</p>

                <li>Fulfilling customer needs and expectations.</li>
                <li>Value creation for investors/stockholders.</li>
                <li>Market growth is increased.</li>

            <h2>CMMI Representation – Staged and Continuous :</h2>
            <p>A representation allows an organization to pursue a different set of improvement objectives. There are
                two representations for CMMI :</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Staged Representation :</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>uses a pre-defined set of process areas to define improvement path.</li>
                        <li>provides a sequence of improvements, where each part in the sequence serves as a foundation
                            for the next.</li>
                        <li>an improved path is defined by maturity level.</li>
                        <li>maturity level describes the maturity of processes in organization.</li>
                        <li>Staged CMMI representation allows comparison between different organizations for multiple
                            maturity levels.</li>

                <li><strong>Continuous Representation :</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>allows selection of specific process areas.</li>
                        <li>uses capability levels that measures improvement of an individual process area.</li>
                        <li>Continuous CMMI representation allows comparison between different organizations on a
                            process-area-by-process-area basis.</li>
                        <li>allows organizations to select processes which require more improvement.</li>
                        <li>In this representation, order of improvement of various processes can be selected which
                            allows the organizations to meet their objectives and eliminate risks.</li>

            <h2>CMMI Model – Maturity Levels :</h2>
            <p>In CMMI with staged representation, there are five maturity levels described as follows :</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Maturity level 1 :</strong> Initial

            <p>A capability level includes relevant specific and generic practices for a specific process area that can
