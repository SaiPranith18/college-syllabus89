    <h2>Abstraction</h2>
    <p>Abstraction is the process of hiding the implementation details and showing only the essential features of the software. It allows developers to focus on what the system does rather than how it achieves its functionality.</p>
    
    <h2>Modularity</h2>
    <p>Modularity refers to the principle of breaking a system into smaller, independent modules or components. Each module performs a specific function and can be developed, tested, and maintained separately, promoting reusability and ease of maintenance.</p>
    
    <h2>Encapsulation</h2>
    <p>Encapsulation is the bundling of data and methods that operate on the data into a single unit, called a class. It restricts access to the internal state of an object and only allows manipulation through well-defined interfaces, enhancing data integrity and security.</p>
    
    <h2>Inheritance</h2>
    <p>Inheritance is the mechanism by which a class inherits properties and behaviors from another class, known as the superclass or base class. It promotes code reuse and allows for the creation of hierarchies of classes with shared characteristics.</p>
    
    <h2>Polymorphism</h2>
    <p>Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It enables dynamic method dispatch, where the method to be executed is determined at runtime based on the type of object, facilitating flexibility and extensibility in software design.</p>
