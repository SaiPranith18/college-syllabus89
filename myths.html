        <h1>Brief description about Software Myths
        </h1>
<strong>Software Myths:</strong>

Most, experienced experts have seen myths or superstitions (false beliefs or interpretations) or misleading attitudes (naked users) which creates major problems for management and technical people. The types of software-related myths are listed below.
        <img src="Myth1.png" alt="Myth" width="250">
        <h3>(i) Management Myths:</h3>

        <p><strong>Myth 1:</strong><br>
        We have all the standards and procedures available for software development.</p>
        <p><strong>Fact:</strong><br>
        Software experts do not know all the requirements for the software development.
        And all existing processes are incomplete as new software development is based on new and different problem.</p>

        <p><strong>Myth 2:</strong><br>
        The addition of the latest hardware programs will improve the software development.</p>
        <p><strong>Fact:</strong><br>
        The role of the latest hardware is not very high on standard software development; instead (CASE) Engineering tools help the computer, they are more important than hardware to produce quality and productivity.
        Hence, the hardware resources are misused.</p>

        <p><strong>Myth 3:</strong><br>
        With the addition of more people and program planners to Software development can help meet project deadlines (If lagging behind).</p>
        <p><strong>Fact:</strong><br>
        If software is late, adding more people will merely make the problem worse. This is because the people already working on the project now need to spend time educating the newcomers, and are thus taken away from their work. The newcomers are also far less productive than the existing software engineers, and so the work put into training them to work on the software does not immediately meet with an appropriate reduction in work.</p>

        <h3>(ii) Customer Myths:</h3>

        <p><strong>Myth 1:</strong><br>
        A general statement of intent is enough to start writing plans (software development) and details of objectives can be done over time.</p>
        <p><strong>Fact:</strong><br>
        Official and detailed description of the database function, ethical performance, communication, structural issues and the verification process are important.
        Unambiguous requirements (usually derived iteratively) are developed only through effective and continuous communication between customer and developer.</p>

        <p><strong>Myth 2:</strong><br>
        Software requirements continually change, but change can be easily accommodated because software is flexible</p>
        <p><strong>Fact:</strong><br>
        It is true that software requirements change, but the impact of change varies with the time at which it is introduced. When requirements changes are requested early (before design or code has been started), the cost impact is relatively small. However, as time passes, the cost impact grows rapidly—resources have been committed, a design framework has been established, and change can cause upheaval that requires additional resources and major design modification.</p>

        <h3>(iii) Practitioner’s Myths:</h3>

        <p><strong>Myths 1:</strong><br>
        They believe that their work has been completed with the writing of the plan.</p>
        <p><strong>Fact:</strong><br>
        It is true that every 60-80% effort goes into the maintenance phase (as of the latter software release). Efforts are required, where the product is available first delivered to customers.</p>

        <p><strong>Myths 2:</strong><br>
        There is no other way to achieve system quality, until it is “running”.</p>
        <p><strong>Fact:</strong><br>
        Systematic review of project technology is the quality of effective software verification method. These updates are quality filters and more accessible than test.</p>

        <p><strong>Myth 3:</strong><br>
        An operating system is the only product that can be successfully exported project.</p>
        <p><strong>Fact:</strong><br>
        A working system is not enough, the right document brochures and booklets are also required to provide guidance & software support.</p>

        <p><strong>Myth 4:</strong><br>
        Engineering software will enable us to build powerful and unnecessary document & always delay us.</p>
        <p><strong>Fact:</strong><br>
        Software engineering is not about creating documents. It is about creating a quality product. Better quality leads to reduced rework. And reduced rework results in faster delivery times.</p>
