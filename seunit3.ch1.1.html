    <h2>Design Process</h2>
    <p>In software engineering, the design process involves transforming requirements into a solution that fulfills those requirements. It typically consists of several iterative steps:</p>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Requirements Analysis:</strong> Understanding and documenting user needs and system requirements. This step often involves communication with stakeholders to clarify requirements.</li>
      <li><strong>System Design:</strong> Creating high-level and low-level designs that describe the system architecture and internal components. This includes decisions about software architecture, data structures, algorithms, and interfaces.</li>
      <li><strong>Implementation:</strong> Writing code and building the software according to the design specifications. This step involves translating the design into executable code and may require collaboration among developers.</li>
      <li><strong>Testing:</strong> Verifying that the software meets requirements and functions correctly. Testing can include unit testing, integration testing, system testing, and user acceptance testing.</li>
      <li><strong>Maintenance:</strong> Making updates, fixes, and improvements to the software throughout its lifecycle. This step ensures that the software remains relevant and effective as user needs evolve.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Design Quality</h2>
    <p>Design quality refers to the characteristics of a software design that determine its effectiveness, efficiency, maintainability, and other desirable attributes. Key aspects of design quality include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Correctness:</strong> The design accurately represents the requirements and produces the intended outcomes. Errors and bugs should be minimized through thorough testing.</li>
      <li><strong>Modularity:</strong> The design is divided into independent modules that can be developed, tested, and maintained separately. This promotes reusability, extensibility, and easier collaboration among developers.</li>
      <li><strong>Flexibility:</strong> The design can accommodate changes and extensions without requiring extensive modifications to existing components. This is achieved through clear interfaces, well-defined abstractions, and flexible architectures.</li>
      <li><strong>Scalability:</strong> The design can handle increasing amounts of data or users without significant degradation in performance. Scalability is achieved through efficient algorithms, data structures, and distributed architectures.</li>
      <li><strong>Usability:</strong> The design is intuitive and easy to use for its intended users. Usability considerations include user interface design, user interactions, and accessibility.</li>
      <li><strong>Performance:</strong> The design meets performance requirements, such as response time and throughput. Performance optimization may involve profiling, tuning, and using appropriate algorithms and data structures.</li>
      <li><strong>Security:</strong> The design incorporates security measures to protect against unauthorized access and data breaches. This includes authentication, authorization, encryption, and secure coding practices.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Ensuring high design quality is essential for developing reliable, maintainable, and successful software systems. Design quality can be evaluated through reviews, inspections, and measurements against quality metrics.</p>
