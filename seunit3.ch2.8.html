        <h2>What are Sequence Diagrams?</h2>
        <p>Sequence diagrams are a type of UML (Unified Modeling Language) diagram used in software engineering to visualize the interactions between objects or components in a system. They illustrate the sequence of messages exchanged between objects over time.</p>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Components of a Sequence Diagram</h2>
        <p>A sequence diagram consists of objects, lifelines, messages, activations, and lifeline notations. Objects represent instances of classes or components, lifelines depict the lifespan of objects, messages indicate interactions between objects, activations represent the period during which an object is performing an operation, and lifeline notations show the creation or destruction of objects.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Interactions Depicted in Sequence Diagrams</h2>
        <p>Sequence diagrams depict various types of interactions, including synchronous and asynchronous messages, method calls, return values, loops, conditions, and parallel executions. They help in understanding the flow of control and data between objects in a system.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Uses of Sequence Diagrams</h2>
        <p>Sequence diagrams are used for requirements analysis, system design, and testing in software development. They aid in understanding the behavior of a system, identifying potential bottlenecks or errors, and ensuring that system requirements are met.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Benefits of Sequence Diagrams</h2>
        <p>Sequence diagrams provide a visual representation of system behavior, making it easier to communicate and understand complex interactions. They help in detecting errors early in the development process, improving system design, and facilitating collaboration among team members.</p>
