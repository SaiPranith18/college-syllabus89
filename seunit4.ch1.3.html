        <h1>Differences between Black Box Testing and White Box Testing</h1>
        <p>Software Testing can be majorly classified into two categories:</p>

        <h2>Black Box Testing</h2>
        <p>Black Box Testing is a software testing method in which the internal structure/design/implementation of the item being tested is not known to the tester. Only the external design and structure are tested.</p>

        <h2>White Box Testing</h2>
        <p>White Box Testing is a software testing method in which the internal structure/design/implementation of the item being tested is known to the tester. Implementation and impact of the code are tested.</p>

        <p>Black box testing and white box testing are two different approaches to software testing, and their differences are as follows:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Black box testing is a testing technique in which the internal workings of the software are not known to the tester. The tester only focuses on the input and output of the software. Whereas, White box testing is a testing technique in which the tester has knowledge of the internal workings of the software, and can test individual code snippets, algorithms and methods.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Differences</h2>
        <p><strong>Testing objectives:</strong> Black box testing is mainly focused on testing the functionality of the software, ensuring that it meets the requirements and specifications. White box testing is mainly focused on ensuring that the internal code of the software is correct and efficient.</p>
        <p><strong>Knowledge level:</strong> Black box testing does not require any knowledge of the internal workings of the software, and can be performed by testers who are not familiar with programming languages. White box testing requires knowledge of programming languages, software architecture and design patterns.</p>
        <p><strong>Testing methods:</strong> Black box testing uses methods like equivalence partitioning, boundary value analysis, and error guessing to create test cases. Whereas, white box testing uses methods like control flow testing, data flow testing and statement coverage.</p>
        <p><strong>Scope:</strong> Black box testing is generally used for testing the software at the functional level. White box testing is used for testing the software at the unit level, integration level and system level.</p>
        <p><strong>Advantages and disadvantages:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Black box testing is easy to use, requires no programming knowledge and is effective in detecting functional issues. However, it may miss some important internal defects that are not related to functionality.</li>
            <li>White box testing is effective in detecting internal defects, and ensures that the code is efficient and maintainable. However, it requires programming knowledge and can be time-consuming.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Both black box testing and white box testing are important for software testing, and the choice of approach depends on the testing objectives, the testing stage, and the available resources.</p>
