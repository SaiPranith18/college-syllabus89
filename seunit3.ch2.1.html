  <h1>Fundamentals of Software Architecture</h1>

  <img width="100%" height="100%" src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/software_architecture_design/images/software_architecture_types.jpg" alt="sa">
  <p>In the world of technology, software applications simplify tasks for users across all age groups, from children to the elderly. While software appears simple to the end-user, its development involves complex processes, with coding being just one aspect.</p>

  <p>After business requirements are gathered by a business analyst, the development team begins working on the Software Requirement Specification (SRS). This document undergoes various steps such as testing, acceptance, deployment, and maintenance, all of which are part of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC).</p>

  <h2>Software Architecture</h2>

  <p>Software architecture defines the fundamental organization of a system and provides a structured solution. It dictates how software components are assembled, their relationships, and communication between them, serving as a blueprint for development teams.</p>

  <div class="characteristics">
    <h2>Characteristics of Software Architecture</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Operational Architecture Characteristics:</strong> Availability, Performance, Reliability, Scalability.</li>
      <li><strong>Structural Architecture Characteristics:</strong> Configurability, Extensibility, Maintainability, Portability.</li>
      <li><strong>Cross-Cutting Architecture Characteristics:</strong> Accessibility, Security, Usability, Privacy.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="principles">
    <h2>SOLID Principles of Software Architecture</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Single Responsibility:</strong> Each service should have a single objective.</li>
      <li><strong>Open-Closed Principle:</strong> Software modules should be independent and expandable.</li>
      <li><strong>Liskov Substitution Principle:</strong> Independent services should be able to communicate and substitute each other.</li>
      <li><strong>Interface Segregation Principle:</strong> Software should be divided into microservices without redundancies.</li>
      <li><strong>Dependency Inversion Principle:</strong> Higher-level modules should not depend on lower-level modules, and changes in higher levels should not affect lower levels.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="importance">
    <h2>Importance of Software Architecture</h2>
    <p>Software architecture is crucial in the design phase of the SDLC. It provides a solid foundation for software projects, facilitates early prototyping, allows system building in components, and helps manage changes in the system. It also impacts factors such as the quality, reliability, maintainability, supportability, and performance of software.</p>
  </div>

  <h2>Advantages of Software Architecture</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Provides a solid foundation for software projects.</li>
    <li>Increases performance.</li>
    <li>Reduces development cost.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Disadvantages of Software Architecture</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Difficulty in obtaining good tools and standardization.</li>
    <li>Initial prediction of project success based on architecture is not always possible.</li>
  </ul>
