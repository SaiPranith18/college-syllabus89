  <h1>User Requirements</h1>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Definition:</strong> User requirements, also known as functional requirements or stakeholder requirements, are descriptions of what a system should do from the perspective of its users.</li>
    <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> They focus on the needs, expectations, and goals of the end-users or stakeholders.</li>
    <li><strong>Content:</strong> User requirements typically include features, functionalities, and constraints that users expect from the system.</li>
    <li><strong>Example:</strong> For a social media platform, user requirements might include the ability to create posts, comment on posts, like or dislike content, and have privacy settings to control who can see their posts.</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>System Requirements</h2>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Definition:</strong> System requirements, also known as technical requirements or software requirements, are descriptions of the functions and constraints necessary for the system to meet user requirements.</li>
    <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> They focus on detailing how the system will function, the technology it will use, and the constraints it must adhere to.</li>
    <li><strong>Content:</strong> System requirements include details such as hardware and software specifications, performance criteria, security considerations, and integration requirements.</li>
    <li><strong>Example:</strong> For the same social media platform, system requirements might specify the programming language, database system, server specifications, response times for various operations, and security protocols.</li>
  </ol>

  <div class="relationship">
    <h2>Relationship between User and System Requirements</h2>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Alignment:</strong> System requirements should be derived from user requirements to ensure that the system meets the needs and expectations of its users.</li>
      <li><strong>Traceability:</strong> Each system requirement should be traceable back to one or more user requirements, ensuring that all user needs are addressed by the system.</li>
      <li><strong>Negotiation:</strong> Sometimes, there may be conflicts between user requirements and system constraints. In such cases, negotiation between stakeholders is necessary to find a balance that satisfies both parties.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>In essence, user requirements define what the system should accomplish, while system requirements define how the system will accomplish it. Both are crucial for the successful development and implementation of software systems.</p>
